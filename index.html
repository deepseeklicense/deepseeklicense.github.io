      <h1>DeepSeek Lisence FAQ</h1>
      <p> <a href="https://deepseeklicense.github.io/index-CN.html">中文版</a> / English Version</p>
    </center>
    <p>Since their release, the DeepSeek series of open-source models have attracted widespread attention from the tech community, with many developers conducting derivative development based on the DeepSeek model or building upper-layer applications. Meanwhile, we have also received inquiries about our model open-source licenses and usage restrictions. To help everyone further understand our open-source policy and alleviate concerns about using the DeepSeek models, this article will answer some of the most common questions.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to DeepSeek Open Source License</h2>
    <hr style="border: 1.5px solid gray;">
    <p>DeepSeek applies different licenses for code repository and model:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Code</strong>: MIT license（<a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder/blob/main/LICENSE-CODE">Example</a>）</li>
      <li><strong>Model</strong>: A custom open-source license（<a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder/blob/main/LICENSE-MODEL">Example</a>）</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The MIT license applied to the code is a standard license and will not be elaborated further here. The custom license used for the model is modified based on the OpenRAIL license, characterized by its <strong>adaptability</strong>, <strong>openness</strong>, and <strong>responsibility</strong>:：</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adaptability</strong>, focusing on model parameters and weights, rather than code.</li>
      <li><strong>Openness</strong>, with permissive open-source conditions and restrictions, encourages the sharing, utilization, and distribution of open-source achievements, stimulating more creativity.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsibility</strong>, advocating for the adoption of behavior-based usage restrictions in the license to reduce the risks of harm from artificial intelligence technology.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Open Source Policy FAQ</h2>
     <hr style="border: 1.5px solid gray;">

    <p>Here are some common questions and answers for developers using this model license.</p>

    <h4>Can DeepSeek open-source models be used for commercial purposes?</h4>

    <p>YES.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">All current DeepSeek open-source models can be used for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to direct deployment, derivative development (such as fine-tuning, quantization, distillation) for deployment, developing proprietary products based on the model and derivatives of the model to provide services, or integrating into a model platform for distribution or providing remote access.</p>

  <h4>Will DeepSeek charge fees or claim a share of the profits from users of the open-source models?</h4>

  <p>NO.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">DeepSeek open-source models are completely free, with no licensing fees. Users can develop derivatives of the model, product applications, and generate content based on the DeepSeek open-source model, and DeepSeek will not claim any profits or benefits generated by users in the aforementioned uses.</p>

  <h4>Do I need to apply or register with DeepSeek before using the open-source models?</h4>

  <p>NO.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">Developers can freely obtain and use DeepSeek open-source models without any application or registration with DeepSeek.</p>

  <h4>Do I need to give a license notice when distributing derivative models or products based on DeepSeek open-source models?</h4>

  <p>YES.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">The DeepSeek license requires notice conditions. It's recommended that users, when distributing derivatives of model or releasing products, provide a copy of the license to third parties in an appropriate manner, retain the copyright notice, and state any modifications to the model.</p>

  <h4>Do I need to open source the derivative model developed based on DeepSeek open-source models?</h4>

  <p>NO.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">The DeepSeek license differs from "copyleft" licenses such as the GPL in that it does not require the open sourcing of derivative models, allowing users the freedom to choose whether to open source or not.</p>
 
  <h4>After modifying or developing the DeepSeek open-source model, is it required to release or distribute the derivative model under the same DeepSeek license?</h4>

  <p>NO.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">When developers release or distribute derivatives of model in the open-source community, they can freely choose licenses that do not conflict with this one (for example they shall include the same use-based restrictions as this license).</p>

  <h4>Does the DeepSeek open-source model have any use-based restrictions?</h4>

 <p>YES.</p>

   <p class="gray-text">The DeepSeek license, consistent with current mainstream open-source model licenses, requires avoidance of illegal or dangerous purposes, as detailed in the license's Attachment A (Use Restrictions).</p>
