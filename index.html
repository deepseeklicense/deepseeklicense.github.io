      <h1>DeepSeek License FAQ</h1>
      <p> <a href="https://deepseeklicense.github.io/index-CN.html">中文版</a> / English Version</p>
    </center>
    <p>The DeepSeek series of open-source models have attracted widespread attention from the tech community since their release. Numerous developers have been engagaed in derivative development based on the DeepSeek model or have built upper-layer applications. Meanwhile, we have also received inquiries regarding our model open-source licenses and use restrictions. To enhance understanding of our open-source policy and address concerns about the utilization of DeepSeek models, this article will provide responses to some frequently asked questions.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to DeepSeek Open Source Licenses</h2>
    <hr style="border: 1.5px solid gray;">
    <p>DeepSeek applies different licenses for code repository and model:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Code</strong>: MIT license（<a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder/blob/main/LICENSE-CODE">Example</a>）</li>
      <li><strong>Model</strong>: A custom open-source license（<a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder/blob/main/LICENSE-MODEL">Example</a>）</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The MIT license is a standard license and will not be elaborated herein. The custom license applicable to the model is modified based on the OpenRAIL license, characterized by its <strong>adaptability</strong>, <strong>openness</strong>, and <strong>responsibility</strong>:：</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adaptability</strong>, focusing on model parameters and weights, rather than code.</li>
      <li><strong>Openness</strong>, with permissive open-source conditions and restrictions, encouraging the sharing, utilization, and distribution of open-source achievements, and stimulating more creativity.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsibility</strong>, advocating for the adoption of behavioral-use restrictions in the license to mitigate the risks associated with artificial intelligence technology.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Open Source Policy FAQ</h2>
     <hr style="border: 1.5px solid gray;">

    <p>Here are the responses to the frequently asked questions developers encounter regarding this model license.</p>

    <h4>Are DeepSeek open-source models permissible for commercial use?</h4>

    <p>YES.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">All current DeepSeek open-source models can be utilized for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to direct deployment, derivative development (such as fine-tuning, quantization, distillation) for deployment, developing proprietary products based on the model and derivative models to provide services, or integrating into a model platform for distribution or providing remote access.</p>

  <h4>Will DeepSeek charge fees or claim a share of the profits from developers of the open-source models?</h4>

  <p>NO.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">DeepSeek open-source models are available at no cost. Developers can develop derivative models, product applications, and generate content based on DeepSeek open-source models. DeepSeek will not claim any profits or benefits developers may derive from these activities.</p>

  <h4>Is it required to apply or register with DeepSeek before using the open-source models?</h4>

  <p>NO.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">Developers can freely access and utilize DeepSeek open-source models without any application or registration requirements.</p>

  <h4>Is it required to give any license or copyright notice when distributing derivative models or products based on DeepSeek open-source models?</h4>

  <p>YES.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">The DeepSeek license requires license and copyright notice conditions. It's recommended that developers, when distributing derivative models or releasing products, provide a copy of the license to third parties in an appropriate manner, retain the copyright notice, and promintly state any modifications to the model.</p>

  <h4>Is it required to open source the derivative model developed based on DeepSeek open-source models?</h4>

  <p>NO.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">The DeepSeek license differs from "copyleft" licenses such as the GPL, which require the open sourcing of derivative works. It grants developers the flexibility to decide whether to open source their derivative models or not.</p>
 
  <h4>Is it required to release or distribute the derivative models modified or developed based on DeepSeek open-source models under the original DeepSeek license?</h4>

  <p>NO.</p>

    <p class="gray-text">When developers release or distribute derivative models in the open-source community, they have the flexibility to choose different licenses that do not conflict with this original one. Nonetheless, it is mandatory for them to include - at minimum - the same use-based restrictions as outlined in this model license.</p>

  <h4>Do DeepSeek open-source models have any use-based restrictions?</h4>

 <p>YES.</p>

   <p class="gray-text">The DeepSeek license, in alignment with prevailing open-source model licensing practices, prohibits its use for illegal or hazardous activities. For detailed restrictions, please refer to Attachment A (Use Restrictions) to the model license.</p>
